## Gameplay Instructions 🎯

### Objective 🌍

In RETURN TO LIFE, players will choose between six unique zones of the planet, each representing a different ecosystem, such as forests, deserts, oceans, and glaciers. The ultimate goal is to heal and restore life to these devastated environments.

🌳 Forest Zone: Reforest and balance carbon reduction by measuring soil pH and other environmental factors.
🏜 Desert Zone: Reclaim arid lands by revitalizing water sources and managing extreme temperatures.
🌊 Ocean Zone: Monitor and regulate water temperature to preserve coral reefs and marine life.
❄️ Glacier Zone: Protect and rebuild the ice caps by addressing melting glaciers and rising sea levels.
🏙 Urban Zone: Restore green spaces and promote sustainability in urban areas by reducing pollution and waste.
💧 Lake Zone: Balance freshwater ecosystems by revitalizing lakes, rivers, and wetlands.

Players will explore these zones, collect resources, solve environmental puzzles, and gather real-world environmental data that contributes to global efforts to restore the planet's balance. The game's focus is on teaching the player about the importance of climate action and ecosystem restoration through interactive and engaging gameplay.
